# Push_Swap

## Task
The goal of this project is to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions, aiming to achieve the lowest possible number of actions.

## How to build and run
### Build it using:
```
git clone git@github.com:JohannaGcd/Push_Swap.git && cd Push_Swap && make
```
### Run it using:
```
./push_swap <random list of integers>
```

## What I Learned
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating efficient sorting algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Working with stacks.
- **Optimization**: Minimizing the number of operations.
- **C Programming**: Implementing the solution in C.
- **Makefile Usage**: Automating the build process.
